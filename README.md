# Lokals - a Startup Weekend Project
Lokals is a mobile application that connects tourists with local people. This project is the MVP.
* It consists of a landing page, describing what lokals is about, and a chat to test if tourists are willing to talk with local people.
* It is a scala application

**To run**: Execute `activator universal:packageZipTarball` and then `./bin/triptailor &`
